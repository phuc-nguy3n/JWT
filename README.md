#JSON Web Token (JWT)

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

JWT is commonly used for authentication and authorization between a client and a server. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing the user's authentication information and sends it to the client. The client then sends this JWT back to the server with subsequent requests to authenticate the user and access protected resources.
